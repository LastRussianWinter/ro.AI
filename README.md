# Roblox AI

Hello! This is a version of an Open source AI that I call 'ro.AI.'

# How to Install

Well this takes a little more then your standard script to install!

First you need an executor, Best Right now is Synapse X.
Secondly you need to download NueralNetwork.lua into your Workspace folder
Thirdly, you need to download TrainingData.json into your Workspace folder
Fourthly you need to run the script on Synapse and it should work its magic, (You need to be active in the night for the AI to work.)
